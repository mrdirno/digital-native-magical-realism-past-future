## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character uses a mundane piece of technology to 'save' an intangible, precious moment from a loved one who is losing their memory.
- Describe a heist to recover a lost piece of art, not the physical object, but its emotional resonance, from the digital 'echo' of the gallery where it was first displayed.
- Create a monologue for a 'digital magpie' defending their work to someone who believes all data should be public domain or should fade away naturally.
- Imagine a conversation between a scent-archivist like Elara and a perfumer from the past, where they communicate only through the sensory impressions left in old letters and recipes.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for 'olfactory memory' retrieval, detailing its inputs (e.g., biometric echoes, emotional metadata) and its outputs (a constructed scent profile).
- Outline the architecture of a 'spectral key'—a data packet that mimics obsolete system pings to gain access. What legacy data formats and protocols would it need to emulate?
